# Codecademy- Mixed Messages App

This app (not currently applied) provides a fortune by randomly choosing three sets of data from respective arrays: luck, fortune, and a direction. All possible output is stored in an Object and a single function (fortuneButton())
will create a new fortune each time it is called. Hopefully this can be mapped to a website button in the future. 

## Technologies Used

- IDE: VScode
- Languages:
  1. Markdown
  2. JavaScript
- Runtime: Node.js
- Version Control: Git, Github

## Launch

Use Node.js or any Javascript runtime environment to see output. Will be applied to a website later with access link to come.
