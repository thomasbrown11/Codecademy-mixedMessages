# Program Objects: 
- Render a randomized fortune with three distinct randomized pieces 

## Planning 

- Should use 3 separate arrays with 5 messages a piece to tell a fortune. 
- Use Math.floor(Math.random()*5) to assign one of the strings in the array... would be cool if the number was attached to an index (probably separate from the run function) of the array and then would just output the index.
